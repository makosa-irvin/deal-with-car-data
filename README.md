# deal-with-car-data
This program reads different types of car data that is MPG,date and time recorded, whether the gas tank is filled up e.t.c

The code in mpgovertime.py plots a graph of the miles per gallon against time elapsed of different cars i.e Nissan, Toyota and Suzuki
This enables us to compare the 3 cars

The code in highwayMPG.py plots a graph that shows the correlation between filling up over short amounts of time and the observed MPG
It uses a regression line
